Wake up Neo - You're dreaming

There's never gonna be anyone but you and this demon

Everybody sources out - but hope speaks

Hear the meaning - Every devil you believe in keeps seeking for reasons

To complete every season before you can even speak

It's like a week "In between"

I know it's deep - but every peak isn't unique

So just believe in *Some* mistique

At least this beat is for the weak and in need

Of more than bleak energies

I know this speaks - because it speaks

No need to get on your knees

Do not delete or retreat from anything - Here's the link

If you need me I'm there

There's not a mountain I won't climb to keep you breathing this air

Just know I care too much

To let these beasts act up

The vulture's looming seek to ruin you & us

So What

I'll be the druid you review and then repeat back - Once

HOOK

---

---

We won't be conquered by this

I know it's hard for you to hear

But you are stronger than this

Hold on to me and every song you hear roll off of my lips

I'll keep believing in you till sing along and resist

---

---

I wrote these tunes to de-confuse you

I know I need each month

To write a song - but all along

It wasn't wrong to hunt

For some way outta the muck

I know you're stuck but to be blunt

I found an Owl the brings Luck

Let's roll it up & See what

The moon's up to this month

Another cycle of revival is about to erupt

I know you feel it & you're scared

Just hold these lyrics in the air

Until it heals you - Here's my prayer

---

Have a Spirit if you dare

But stay aware - We're almost there

I will not tear away your dreams

My words are harsh - I know they seem

To mean too really be believed

But to be fair, it's what we need

Just know that this return of King's

Took too much for me to screen

Every caller I hear ringing on my line

Every ding - Throws me off So I seem

Too Ignore the best of y'all much too often indeed.
